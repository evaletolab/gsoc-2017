#Rationale

The [Global Alliance for Genomics and Health](http://genomicsandhealth.org) aims at promoting the efficient use of distributed genomics data resources, through the development of data standard and APIs, as well as the support of legal, ethical and security frameworks for the use of human "omics" and associated metadata.

As part of human data implementation studies supported through the [ELIXIR](http://elixir-europe.org) European bioinformatics network, we are making use of the cancer genome data represented in the [arrayMap](http://arraymap.org) resource, to advance and test real-life implementations of the [GA4GH data schema](http://github.com/ga4gh/schemas/).

#Approach

The aim of the project is to apply GA4GH schemas and an API on top of our database [arrayMap](http://arrayma.org) that hosts cancer related data for humans.

#Challenges

Large amounts of data need to be dealt with, and cutting edge (not yet fully specified) standards need to be applied.

#Requirements
Knowledge about the following technologies is required:
 
 - JavaScript
 - MongoDB
 - HTTP/REST
 - Perl, Python

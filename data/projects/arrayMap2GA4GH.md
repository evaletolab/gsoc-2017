### arrayMap2GA4GH - A web interface and API implementation for the arrayMap GA4GH development implementation

The [Global Alliance for Genomics and Health](http://genomicsandhealth.org) aims at promoting the efficiant use of distributed genomics data resources, through the development of data standard and APIs, as well as the support of legal, ethical and security frameworks for the use of human "omics" and associated metadata.

As part of human data implementation studies supported through the [Elixir](http://elixir-europe.org) European bioinformatics network, we are making use of the cancer genome data represented in the [arrayMap](http://arraymap.org) resource, to advance and test real-life implementations of the [GA4GH data schema](http://github.com/ga4gh/schemas/).

This project is aimed at the implementation of a web interface and API implementation for the GA4GH schema native [MongoDB](http://mongodb.org) implementation of the [arrayMap](http://arraymap.org) dataset.
